# Split-PDF-Script
The Split PDF Script is a Python tool that divides large PDFs into structured, smaller files. Users specify folder and file counts, ensuring organized distribution. Each PDF gets a unique aviation-related name and is randomly placed in folders. The script automates even page distribution, making it ideal for document management and archiving. ðŸš€
